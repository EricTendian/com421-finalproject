                <h2>Project Summary</h2>

                <p>The purpose of this project is to create a scheduling program that solves the problem of large amounts of user input that is needed to schedule a meeting. Our team looked closely at the function of two scheduling programs, Doodle.com and When2Meet.com. With Doodle and When2Meet, one person inputs times that suit their schedule; they then send it out to others to check whether they are available during the times selected by one individual. Our team found that this could be very inconvenient because not everyone has the same schedule, and it may be very difficult for people to adjust their schedules to one person’s availability. Considering this, we decided to propose a program that allows multiple users to input their availabilities. The program will hook up to everyone’s Google Calendar and will generate times that everyone is available. If no meeting times are common between all participants, it will generate a time that is common amongst the majority. In this way, the program allows scheduling to become much more compatible with many different people’s schedules.</p>

            <section id="rationale-and-significance">
                <h2>Rationale and Significance</h2>

                <p>Scheduling a meeting can be very complex, and even more so as the number of people needing to meet increases. We are becoming busier and busier, always looking for ways to fit more time into our day. Some people may have multiple calendars for different types of events, so traditional scheduling software does not completely fill the need. Other scheduling websites require lots of user input, such as Doodle, and only one person sets the parameters. The problem with meeting scheduling must be addressed, as it is very inconvenient for businesses and students, wasting up to five hours per week (Doodle blog). Creating a new software that requires very little user input or time to come up with a list of available meeting times would increase productivity significantly and make meetings easy and quick to plan.</p>

            <section id="project-scope">
                <h2>Project Scope</h2>

                <p>The project will take a preexisting template from Doodle or When2Meet.com (or both) and improve it to create a prototype for a program that is more convenient for people. The program itself will not actually be written; rather, changes to the existing templates will be shown and a new User Interface will be created.</p>

            <section id="investigation-methods">
                <h2>Investigation Methods</h2>

                <p>People are still wasting too much time on scheduling their meetings. According to a study made by Mintzberg in 1973, six CEOs spent 60% of all managerial time on arranging schedules over a five week period. (Romano, Nunamaker. 1973)</p>

                <p>Forty years later, things haven’t changed too much. In a survey made by Doodle in 2010, among 1,500 professionals in administrative and managerial positions, the majority of respondents still use traditional forms of communication like telephone calls and e-mail to make appointments, and they spend about six working weeks per year scheduling meetings. Almost a quarter of workers needed seven or more hours per week to coordinate their appointments. Before a single participant was sitting in a conference room, initiators had spent over half an hour arranging the meeting. (Doodle blog) Although this survey was sponsored by Doodle and may contain bias, the proliferation of scheduling applications show the problem of trying to find a meeting time still remains.</p>

                <p>According to Doodle’s survey, the back and forth communication is the most substantial time killer while scheduling, and the number of iterations and time needed grow right along with the number of participants. The data shows that scheduling tools do make a significant difference between people who are using it and people who are not.</p>

                <p>The creator of Doodle claim that it could help people save time. However, Doodle is not perfect. Because by checking one’s own schedule and comparing it with another person’s schedule, a user still must do the calculations on their own. This is still wasting a user’s time.</p>

                <p>In another case <a href="http://when2meet.com">when2meet.com</a>, an online scheduling service, which is similar to Doodle, users need to select the time they want in a week calendar and compare it to their own schedule. It does simplify the scheduling process. Nonetheless, it does not solve the problem which Doodle has, which is that users still need to look up their own schedule and compare it with other’s vacancy. Moreover, users can only make appointments on the present week using <a href="http://when2meet.com">when2meet.com</a> and Doodle.</p>

                <p>Another schedule tool &ndash; x.ai, helps people make their schedule by creating a virtual personal assistant: Amy. Users schedule their meeting by sending and receiving emails from Amy. However, this schedule tool not only retains the unsolved problem, which is that other users have to make their schedule based on the first person’s schedule, but also keeps the trouble of doing ping-pong email for users. To use this scheduling tool, the first person must email Amy his/her recommend date, and Amy will email other people and resolves with the others. Although having a virtual personal assistant is tempting, x.ai will only benefit the person who is the first to schedule with Amy. It still demands other people to email their schedule back and forth.</p>

                <p>According to our research of the market, the existing schedule products need to be improved. More important, people need a more efficient product to help them save time from scheduling.</p>

                <h2>Problem Analysis</h2>

                <p>When going about implementing this idea, we foresee potential problems around workflow and compatibility.</p>

                <p>There could be certain problems with the workflow, as the project plans to adopt certain third-party softwares and components. One problem is that not everyone has a Google account or uses Google Calendar to organize their schedule. Our website would access the user’s Google Calendar, and obtain corresponding information from the website. However, if the user does not have a Google account, then registration will be required, which will make the user’s experience more difficult. A potential solution is to instruct users to create a Google account upon registering for our website if the user does not have one, reducing the confusion.</p>

                <p>Another potential problem is that a user may already have an event at a given time but hasn’t updated their Google Calendar with the event, thus causing our website to choose meeting times which are not the best for everyone. A potential solution is to remind the user to update their Google Calendar whenever him or her signs onto our website. Not everyone will use Google Calendar as their primary schedule planner so they may need to sync events between their primary planner and Google Calendar.</p>

                <p>The most important problem is that Google Calendar, which we will adopt in our site, is not supported in all web-browsers. According to the documentation by Google, their Google Calendar product is only supported by Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari, indicating there could be problems when users are using browsers not supported by Google. As Google Calendar may not support the user's browser, a possible solution is to create our own UI while only using Google Calendar for backend. Still, the compatibility issue may arise, therefore another option would be to recommend user to install one of the compatible browsers when using the website.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>Scheduling is an important part of our daily lives, and will be even more so as we become busier in classes and careers. The need to schedule a meeting will not go away, and our software may become increasingly useful as more people use Google Calendar to manage their schedule. Automatic scheduling is a significant improvement from existing methods which require a lot of manual user input, and we eventually plan to allow the software to integrate with many different platforms to make it even easier. We thank you for your consideration of this project and we hope to be able to develop it further.</p>
